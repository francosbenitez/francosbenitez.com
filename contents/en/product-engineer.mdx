## What is a Product Engineer?

"Product Engineers represent a shift in web development. Especially with the rise of AI, there’s a growing need for developers who do more than "just write code". Developers who understand the bigger picture, who can work across various technologies, and who focus on delivering exceptional products to the end user." — Lee Robinson (https://leerob.com/product-engineers)
