I have a licentiate degree in psychology from the University of Buenos Aires (UBA), Argentina. For those that don’t know, to study at the UBA is necessary to do the CBC, whose acronym means “Ciclo Básico Común” (translated to English, it would be something like “Common Basic Cycle”). The CBC is an instance in which one has to study, generally in a year, some random subjects to familiarize with how to study at university. It could be said, in other words, the CBC is an instance to raise the study level of students. Some people say that, in reality, the CBC is a filter to prevent a lot of people from studying at university (but we won’t enter into this). 

In this way, when I had finished the CBC it’s when I started to be interested in research in psychology. I wanted to be a researcher. Then, throughout the years in my career, I was careful about my grades, tried to find some team research, studied statistics, methodology, English, and, of course, programming. Nearly two years before finishing my career, I started to program in the [R statistical programming language](https://www.r-project.org/). R, for those who don't know, is one of the best tools for data science, next to [Python](https://www.python.org/). I started with R because in academia it is the most used, besides that it was very easy for me to access good R books. My first book in programming was [Data Science for Psychologists](https://bookdown.org/hneth/ds4psy/), by Hansjörg Neth. 

In this same line, a few months later I would start to learn Python in the courses Programación en Python - UNSAM (https://github.com/python-unsam/Programacion_en_Python_UNSAM) and Full Stack Python - Codo a Codo (https://www.buenosaires.gob.ar/educacion/codocodo/el-programa). At par, I was doing the [freeCodeCamp curriculum](https://www.freecodecamp.org/), learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, mainly because I needed to make a website for a psychology movement (the “Movimiento Estudiantil por la Psicología Científica”, known by its acronym “MEPC”). 

At the same time, my research career was growing. But something strange happened. I realize that I love research (I did my undergraduate thesis about the replicability crisis and open science practices in psychology), but I hate the bureaucracy existent in it. I refer to the “title-itis”: everything is titles in academia and everything is scholarships. Also, I realize it’s a lot of effort to live hard (at least in Argentina), with very low wages and a horrible system (culture of “publish or perish”). Here, at this point, was when I had a breaking point: what I had prepared myself for over the years, was not what I really wanted.

Having a lot of discouragement, however, not all was lost. I enjoyed programming a lot. I was good at it. Only I had to do a very little switch: leave off reading scientific articles to start reading documentation, code, and make personal projects. And that I did. Importantly, the change wasn’t too big, being as in many ways the jobs are very similar: 1) both require studying and researching a lot, 2) both require sitting on a chair a lot of hours, and 3) both require having an interest in logical and abstract thinking.

**Final words**

I can’t deny it: If I hadn’t studied psychology, maybe I wouldn't have known programming. I like research, but I prefer to work as a programmer, for which my real skills are more valuable than certificates and titles. And this is a personal preference, I don’t want to say that academia is not valuable: without science, there wouldn’t be anything like humanity.  Only I want to say that academia is not for me. For my part, I only did a small switch: I went from reading science with job expectations and programming as a hobby, to studying programming with job expectations and science as a hobby.  And, I want to emphasize, it was not a big change, because, as I said, in both cases there are big similarities.
