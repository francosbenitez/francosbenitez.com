In my college years, I have worked hard to get the best scores possible in different subjects. However, when I was finishing my third year, I started thinking about why my scores weren’t what I wanted them to be. Namely, while I wanted to have a minimum average score between 9/10 in all subjects, I had a minimum average score of 8.25/10. Why? If I was putting a lot of effort into it. I had to be doing something wrong. Then, I started looking for information on study skills, productivity, and better habits. I googled every Reddit post and every YouTube channel possible about the topics I have already mentioned. What I found (and I have been putting into practice), is what I am going to detail below.

### 1. Time tracking

The beautiful *time tracking*. Time tracking is, simply, a technique based on counting the time in which you are doing something. But, you're not the one who counts the time. The time is reckoned by means of applications (thanks programming for making our lives easier!). 

For this technique, I use the [Toggl](https://toggl.com/) application in its free version, however some people prefer to use the Pomodoro technique, using, for example, the [Forest](https://www.forestapp.cc/) application. An essential article that helped me to understand how to apply time tracking with Toggl is the following: [If the Pomodoro Technique Doesn't Work for You, Try Flowtime](https://zapier.com/blog/flowtime-technique/). 

### 2. Time blocking

*Time blocking* is, basically, to block the time of your life. Putting blocks in your calendar about the things you will do every day, is using time blocking. 

I use Google Calendar for time blocking. Here you’ll find [The Complete Guide to Time Blocking](https://todoist.com/productivity-methods/time-blocking).

### 3. App blockers

If you think you can really control yourself by not using social media, congratulations, you are from another planet! Let’s be honest, it’s very difficult not to tempt us. We say “Only a little bit”, and we can spend many hours scrolling on Facebook, Twitter, or Instagram without realizing it. To avoid this, there are applications that block other applications: these powerful apps are called *app blockers*. The main purpose of using app blockers is that make us less dependent on our limited willpower. 

I use, in this case, [Cold Turkey](https://getcoldturkey.com/) for PC, and [AppBlock](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=cz.mobilesoft.appblock&hl=en&gl=US) for mobile phones. In both cases on their free versions. 

### 4. Sleep

Sleeping well is essential to being productivity. I use apps to reduce the screen light in my eyes at night, such as [f.lux](https://justgetflux.com/) for desktop and [Twilight](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.urbandroid.lux&hl=en&gl=US) for mobile. On the other hand, so as not to sleep too much, I use the [Alarmy](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=droom.sleepIfUCan&hl=en&gl=US) app. This last powerful app forces me to solve mathematical problems when I get up, so I have to solve such problems to turn it off. In both cases, I use these apps in their free versions.

**Note**: For me, seven and a half hours is enough to sleep and feel good the whole day.

### 5. Training

I still don't know if there is scientific evidence about the benefits of training on mental health. But, without any doubt, I would recommend the training to everyone. My life was full of stress before starting to train regularly. And, I believe, it’s not necessary to pay a gym to train. If we don’t wait to become bodybuilders, it’s enough to train with our own body, which is frequently called, in a fashion way, [*callisthenic*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calisthenics). 

### 6. Study

When talking about studying, I would recommend following the [active recall](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fDbxPVn02VU&ab_channel=AliAbdaal) and [spaced repetition](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-zNHHpXoMM&ab_channel=AliAbdaal) study techniques. Briefly, saying it in a rude way: a) spaced repetition: do a little every day; b) active recall: the more you try to remember something, the easier it will be to remember it in the future. 

As free software to apply these techniques, there exists the beautiful [Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net/).

### Final words

Firstly, being productive is a means to an end: get closer to ourselves to accomplish our objectives and wishes. I think none of us is productive just because. Secondly, being productive is like everything: with practise and dedication it improves. That is, we don’t wait to go from studying two hours a day to studying ten hours.  Finally, being productive is, also, to find the best way in which we feel more comfortable with our work. 

I hope these brief tips, which are really important for me, would be important for you too. If you want to discuss something or simply want to talk to me, [send me a message](https://www.francosbenitez.com/#contact)!
