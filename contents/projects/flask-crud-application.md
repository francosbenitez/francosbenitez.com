### What It Is
This is my first CRUD (for those that don't know, "CRUD" stands for "Create, Read, Update, and Delete" records). 

### What I Used
I have made it using Python and its Flask microframework. 

### What It Does
It allows to create, read, update, and delete records. 

### What I Learnt
I learnt how to use MySQL with Python, and how to integrate both of them into an application. 

In the near future, I would like to build a more complex CRUD using the MERN stack.
