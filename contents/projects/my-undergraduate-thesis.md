### What It Is
This is the data analysis of my undergraduate thesis entitled "Perceptions about Replicability Crisis and Open Science".

### What I Used
As the main analysis tool, I used mainly Python, but also made some plots in R. 

### What It Does
This data analysis shows the perceptions of ninety psychological researchers from my college about problems in science (replicability crisis), as well as proposed solutions (open science practices).  

### What I Learnt
In this project I learned a lot about data analysis. For example, I learned how difficult it is to work with real data (as an anecdote, I struggled with creating a regex that removes " years" in a list of ages). 

In addition, this project allowed me to solidify my knowledge of not only Python but also data analysis libraries, such as the popular Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn libraries.
