This is the data analysis of my undergraduate thesis entitled "Perceptions about Replicabilty Crisis and Open Science". As the main analysis tool, I have used mainly Python, but I have also made some plots in R. 

In this project I have learned a lot about data analysis. For example, I have learned how difficult it is to work with real data (as an anecdote, I struggled with creating a regex that removes " years" in a list of ages). 

In addition, this project allowed me to solidify my knowledge of data analysis libraries, such as the popular Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn libraries.
