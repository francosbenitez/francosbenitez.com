### What It Is

This project is my personal website. 

I have created two previous versions ([v1](http://francosbenitez.netlify.app/) and [v2](https://github.com/francosbenitez/v2)) before, but this is the most developed one.

### What I Used

It uses [Forestry](https://forestry.io/ "Forestry") as a git-based CMS.

### What It Does

It shows more about me, my projects and my blog posts. 

It serves mostly as a means to show my programming skills.

### What I Learnt

Next and React more in-depth.

How to use and organize CSS-in-JS.
