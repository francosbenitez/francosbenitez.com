### What It Is
This is my personal website. I created two previous version ([v1](http://francosbenitez.netlify.app/) and [v2](https://github.com/francosbenitez/v2)) before, but this is the most developed version I have ever made.

### What I Used
The website is based on [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/). For styles, it uses [styled-components](https://styled-icons.js.org/). 

### What It Does
This website shows more about me, my projects, and my blog posts. It serves mostly as a means to show my programming skills.   

### What I Learnt
On developing this project, I learned a lot about Next and React in themselves. Obviously, I also learnt a lot about CSS and how to organize it better, given that styled-components is nothing more than pure CSS inside JavaScript.
