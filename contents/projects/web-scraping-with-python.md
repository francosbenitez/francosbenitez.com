### What It Is
This project is a simple web scraping. 

### What I Used
Python and its well known Beautiful Soup library

### What It Does
It scrapes the [Promiedos](https://www.promiedos.com.ar/primera) website extracting five main boards of the Argentine soccer.

### What I Learnt
I learnt a lot about Python in itself and, particularly, how to use it for web scraping.
