### What It Is
This is a Twitter bot, adapted from the tutorial [How to Make a Twitter Bot With Python](https://dylancastillo.co/how-to-make-a-twitter-bot-for-free/)

### What I Used
Python as programming language, the Twitter API, Docker, Ubuntu, and AWS Lambda for automation.

### What It Does
Basically, the bot tweets "No" and its derivatives every day at 15 o'clock (UTC). The answer "No" and its derivatives refers the question "Has the curriculum of this school been updated?".

My interest in creating something like this stemmed from my discomfort with the curriculum at my school where I study psychology. 

### What I Learnt
On developing this project, I dealt with some difficulties connecting Ubuntu to Docker, but I learned a lot about both of them.
