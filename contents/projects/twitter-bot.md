This is a project adapted from the tutorial [How to Make a Twitter Bot With Python](https://dylancastillo.co/how-to-make-a-twitter-bot-for-free/). I had some difficulties connecting Ubuntu to Docker, but I learned a lot about both of them.

Basically, the bot tweets "No" and its derivatives every day at 15 o'clock (UTC). My interest in creating something like this stemmed from my discomfort with the curriculum at my school where I study psychology. The answer "No" and its derivatives refers the question "Has the curriculum of this school been updated?".
