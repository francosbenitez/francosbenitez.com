The first version of this website can be found at [https://mepc.netlify.app/](https://mepc.netlify.app/). It was built using the R blogdown package for creating websites in a easy way. Then, I have created this simple version using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. However, right now we are currently creating a better version using TypeScript, Next, and Tailwind. It will be ready soon!
