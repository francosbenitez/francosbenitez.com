### What It Is
This project is a customized plot. 

### What I Used
R, particularly the well known set of libraries called tidyverse.  

### What It Does
It shows the average age of the texts of Argentine psychology majors.

### What I Learnt
I tried to make a [interactive version of this project using R Shiny](https://francosbenitez.shinyapps.io/carreras_de_psicologia_argentinas/). However, I didn't finish it when I realised that I could create better interactive web stuff using JavaScript. 

In the future I could try to remake this project.
