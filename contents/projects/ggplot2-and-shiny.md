One of my first projects using R, particularly the well known set of libraries called tidyverse. I tried to make a interactive version of this project using R Shiny: [https://francosbenitez.shinyapps.io/carreras_de_psicologia_argentinas/](https://francosbenitez.shinyapps.io/carreras_de_psicologia_argentinas/); however, I didn't finish it when I realised that I could create better interactive web stuff using JavaScript. In the future I could try to remake this project.
