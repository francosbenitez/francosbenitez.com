### What It Is
This project is an organizational website. 

### What I Used
I have created this simple version using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The first version of this website can be found [here](https://mepc.netlify.app/), which was built using the R blogdown package for creating websites in a easy way.

### What It Does
It shows what the organization is and what it does.

### What I Learnt
I learnt a lot about HTML, CSS, and the basics of JavaScript. 

Currently, we are creating a better version of this project using TypeScript, Next, and Tailwind. It's going to be ready soon!
