In my college years, I have worked hard to get the best scores possible in different subjects. However, when I was finishing my third year, I started thinking why my scores weren't what I wanted they were. That is, while I wanted to have an minimum average score of 9/10 in all subjects, I had an minimum average score of 8.25/10. Why? If the effort I put was high. Something I was doing bad. 

Then, I put myself to search information about study techniques, productivity, and better habits. I googled in every Reddit post and every YouTube channel possible about the mentioned topics. What I found (and I have been putting in practise) will be detailed below. 

1. Time tracking

The beautiful time tracking. Time tracking is, simply, a technique based on counting the time in which you are doing something. No, you aren't who count the time. The time is reckoned by means of applications (thanks programming for making our lifes easier!). I use the Toggle application for time tracking. 

2. Time blocking

Time blocking is, basically, to block the time of your life. Put blocks in your calendar about the things you will do every day, it is to use time blocking. Personally, I use Google Calendar for time blocking.

3. App blockers

App blockers are, purely, applications that block other applications. The utility the app blockers have is that make yourself less dependent on your willpower. It's true that our willpower is limited, and that as humans we are very prone to tentation. For example, you can say: "I go in for a while to Facebook, and I leave it"; but, entry to Facebook, and it happens from thirty minutes to one hour (even more) on that social network. To avoid this, the app blockers come to save our productivity. I use Cold Turkey for PC, and AppBlocker for mobile phone. 

4. Sleep

Sleep well is an essential ability to productivity. I use apps to reduce the blue window in your eyes. I use XXX. And, on the other hand, to not sleeping too much, I use the Alarmy app. This app allows me to put mathematical problems when I get up, so that I have to resolve those problems to manage to turn off the alarm.

5. Training

I don't still know if there is scientific evidence about the benefits of training on the mental health. But, without doubt, I would recommend to all the world training regularly. My life was full of stress before starting to train.
