I studied a licentiate degree in psychogy at the University of Buenos Aires (UBA), Argentina. For those that don't know, to study at UBA is neccesary to do the CBC, whose acronym means "Ciclo Básico Común" (or, in English, Common Basic Cicle). Basically, the CBC is a instance in which one has to study some random subjects to familiarize oneself with how to study at University. In other words, the CBC is a instance to raise the study level in students.

Coming back to my story, when finalized the CBC it's when I start to be interested in research in psychology. I wanted, really, to be a researcher. Then, throughout the years in the career, I was careful about my grades, tried to find some team research, and studied statistics, English, and programming.
